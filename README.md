This interactive 3D skeleton viewer is built with Three.js to demonstrate a modular implementation of a product viewer using only basic geometries. The application allows users to explore a detailed human skeleton model through both manual controls and automated camera rotation.

Intuitive Controls:

Drag to rotate the view

Scroll to zoom in/out

Ctrl + drag to pan

Part Selection: Click on any skeleton part to see detailed information

Responsive Design: Works seamlessly on both desktop and mobile devices

Auto-Rotation: Camera automatically orbits around the skeleton

Visual Feedback: Parts highlight on hover and selection

Modular Architecture: Clean code organization with separate modules
